# Online store consultant RADAT

<img src="./images/logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" />


## Description
Our project provides the best solution to the pain point of online consultations in the shops. Our team offers the chat-bot that acts as a professional, answers in a simple user-friendly language without complex terms, remembers the shop stock, recall the dialogue history, and even communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a human.


### Background

Initially, the consultants that worked locally at a specific shop had to answer to both online and offline clients. As a result, the waiting time increased dramitically while the response quality decreased accordingly.

### Features
```
* The consultant will only answer questions about the products or direct the client to those topics.
* The possibility of applying filters.
* The service works without using a VPN.
* The possibility of calling a human consultant.
* Support for additional functionality for registered users.
* Service analytics (processing speed, quality of service).
```

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
```

1) Clone the git repository into your IDE that supports Go programming language and docker deployment.
2) Create .env with two environment variables in the root of the project with the API_KEY and BOT_TOKEN fields.
3) Put in these fields valid DeepSeek API key retreived from https://platform.deepseek.com and bot token for your created bot via @BotFather in Telegram respectively.
4) Having installed Docker on your computer, run docker compose up --build in the IDE Terminal and enjoy the service running.
```


## Support
In case of any misunderstanding and/or technical issues write in the PM to our developer using alias from /help command

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
