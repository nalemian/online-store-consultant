- Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?
- I think it’s complete.
##
- Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not?
- No, this product is not for me.
##
- Has the customer deployed the product on their side?
- No.
##
- What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?
- Within this, it’s just a proof of concept, a minimal MVP to push it somewhere.
The only thing is to add the API to fetch products from the database and some API for
a real store. With those two things, you could maybe even start testing it somewhere.
##
- What are the customer’s plans for the product after its delivery? Are they
going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue collaborating with the
team and on what conditions?
- Well, looking at the plans, you could really finish it and bring it somewhere, submit
it. Collaborating with you, yeah, why not? You’re all comfortable with the codebase,
so why not?
##
- How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after the final delivery?
- Again, by improving it. So, the answer to all these questions is kind of the same.
##
- Is everything clear? What can be improved?
- The README is clear now, it’s enough. Just need to add this one point and
that’s it, README is finished.
- Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?
- Yes
- What two other sections the customer would like to be included in the ReadMe?
- A description of where to add the JSONs – they’re lying locally somewhere in
a folder now. And which methods are responsible for a certain AI, so you can swap
them, where is the method kept that you could swap out to work with another model.
Otherwise, everything’s fine.
